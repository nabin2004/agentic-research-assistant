# Agentic Research Assistant

This repository provides a reproducible pipeline and project scaffold for starting research: collecting raw ideas, iterating with a writer, performing literature reviews on arXiv, collecting metadata and citations, and drafting a LaTeX paper.

Quick highlights:
- Scripts to query arXiv and save BibTeX/CSV metadata
- LaTeX paper template in `latex/`
- Documentation and process notes in `docs/`

Next steps:
1. Provide raw ideas in `docs/raw_ideas.md` and seek writer feedback
2. Run `python scripts/arxiv_search.py --query "your query"` to fetch papers
3. Use `latex/` to write the paper and iterate

See `docs/PROCESS.md` for the recommended workflow.
