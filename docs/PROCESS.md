# Research Process & Workflow

1. Take raw ideas and feelings
2. Create a concise title and short abstract draft
3. Ask the writer for feedback on title & abstract
4. Run literature review (use `scripts/arxiv_search.py`)
5. Collect BibTeX and CSV metadata for shortlisted papers
6. For each paper, note where published (conference/journal) and follow references
7. Start drafting the LaTeX paper in `latex/`
8. Continuously commit and version drafts; iterate with the writer

Notes:
- Keep each commit focused (e.g., "add arXiv results for query X").
- Use `docs/FEEDBACK_TEMPLATE.md` to solicit writer input.
